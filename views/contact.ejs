      <h4>little about me hehe</h4>
      <p>
        you've already probably read everything about me from the home page so
        there isn't much else to say. <br />
        I really enjoy the beach, sunsets, staring at my wallpapers as well as
        my wall / ceiling. I am a bit quirky and weird but I am also a very nice
        person (hopefully). <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also a very big fan of the
        <span class="sub-keywords keyword">The Office</span> and
        <span class="sub-keywords keyword">Modern Family</span> so if you are
        too, we can be friends. <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        I've recently taken interest into low-level programming and I intend to
        contribute to the Linux Kernel some day. So if you are experienced in
        this process, do help me get started by sharing appropriate resources
        and advices. <br />
      </p>
