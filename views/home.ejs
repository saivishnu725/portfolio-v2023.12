          <div class="visually-hidden box" id="computers">
            I've been interested in
            <span class="keyword">computers</span> since I was a 15 year old
            kid. It all started when I got curious on why
            <span class="sub-keywords">int</span> can't store any value above
            <span class="sub-keywords">2147483647</span>. I was fascinated by
            the fact that a computer is very structured and everything that it
            does has a well thought out reason behind it.

            I love the fact that it's open and I can customise it to my liking.
            The mere fact that I have some control on what my computer can do /
            does. I initially got into it mostly because I hated Windows 10.
            This is probably one of the best decisions I've ever made and I
            don't regret it a bit.

            I've been doing a lot of
            <span class="keyword">web dev</span> stuff lately. I think it's
            because I've been kinda demotivated lately and saw some quick
            timepass with web dev. I'm not sure if I'll stick with it though.
            Don't get me wrong. This is a very interesting field and I'm
            learning a lot of new stuff. But it's just not what I am aiming for
            my future to be

            I have tinkered around in a lot of things/tools for the past few
            years and from what I've observed, I've come to this conclusion that
            my heart lies in
            <span class="keyword">low level programming</span>. I really love
            how it is implemented. I've been trying to learn something related
            to it for a while but never got my way around it but it is true that
            every time I think of what my
            <span class="keyword">future role</span> should be, it always ends
            up being something Systems related and specifically Linux or low
            level management. <br />
