# Portfolio

My new Portfolio -v2 ([v1](https://github.com/saivishnu725/portfolio-v2023-10) is stopped because it sucks). _Dated 22/12/2023._

Heavily (downright copying the design without asking any sort of permission but given what I read, I don't think they would send any "legal goons" over it.) inspired by [Nicky Case](https://github.com/ncase)'s [website](https://ncase.me/)

## Plans

1. Design the site!! **_(NOTE: Important)_**
2. Host it lol

## Hosting

1. It won't be hosted until it is completely finished
2. After which, I "might" buy a VPS.
3. The domain is going to be: [theunconcernedape.me](https://theunconcernedape.me) (check out my 3 years old site for now).

## how to check it out locally

1. Install node dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. a. Use nodemon to run the server

   ```bash
   nodemon
   ```

   b. Run the server manually

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

3. Site is live at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open it in your preferred browser.
